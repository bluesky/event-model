# event_model



This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/bluesky/event-model>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install event-model`
Documentation   | <https://bluesky.github.io/event-model>
Releases        | <https://github.com/bluesky/event-model/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from event_model import __version__

print(f"Hello event_model {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m event_model --version
```
